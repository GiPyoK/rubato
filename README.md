# rubato

rubato is an app which user can select a video and an audio files and apply slow motions. A set of markers will be placed on both the video and the audio timeline. The marker on the video timeline indicates the time frame where the slow motion will be applied, and the marker on the audio timeline indicates where the slow motioned video will be played according to the audio playback time. rubato will render the audio and the video into a single file and either save to the hardware or share it on the social media.
